Merso the Pig

	One night after a victorious battle a King ordered his servants to prepare a glorious feast.
He ordered the Hunter to gather as many animals as he can get, especially the Kings favorites pigs and he ordered the cruel Butcher to prepare them.

	Meanwhile in the woods among the other animals there lived a family of pigs and in this family a little pig named Mersu. Now Mersu was not like the other animals, he wouldn't play the games with other animals and you could say that he was a stranger to feelings. He often questioned life, everything was absurd and meaningless to him. He lived day after day growing more and more bored, little did he know...the Hunter had arrived. He started snatching up the animals one by one, including Mersu and his family.

	When they arrived at the castle the Hunter went to get the Butcher and left the cages with the animals in the hall. Merso never felt this way, he was afraid. Some smaller animals managed to escape out of the cages, Mersu was one of them. The Butcher slammed the door open so Merso quickly hid, the others did not... (a scene of the dead animals with blood on the walls)... 

	The Hunter took the cages with the screaming animals and went into the shadowy hall..and the foolish Mersu followed.
